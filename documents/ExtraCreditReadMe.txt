README:

My app has an extra functionality where the user may enter any number of candidates to include on the ballot instead of just three (as specified in the standard input file).

My BallotReader class reads the second line of the input file (i.e., the one that specifies the number of candidates) and stores a list of candidates accordingly, instead of just writing the number to the output file and assuming that there will be three candidates on the ballot.
